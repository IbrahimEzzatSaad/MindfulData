# What is Heap????

Heap data structure is  [a complete binary tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/complete-binary-tree)  that satisfies  **the heap property**, where any given node is

-   always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called  **max heap property**.
-   always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called  **min heap property**.

## Heap applications
Some useful applications of a heap include:
-  Calculating the minimum or maximum element of a collection.
-  Heap sort.
-  Implementing a priority queue.
-  Supporting graph algorithms, like Primâ€™s or Dijkstraâ€™s, with a priority queue.

**Common heap operations**

Here you have a generic Collection interface with the basic property count which returns the number of elements and the boolean property isEmpty which just tests if the count is 0.
It also contains the classical operations of inserting and deletion.

## Key points
- Hereâ€™s a summary of the algorithmic complexity of the heap operations implemented in this package:

-  The heap data structure is good for maintaining the highest or lowest priority element.
- Every time you insert or remove items from the heap, you must check to see if it satisfies the rules of the priority.
